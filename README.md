# Golang-Programs

Repository of Programs in the Go programming language

# Overview

This repository contains small programs that I wrote while learning the Golang, or Go language. I learned Go by completing a course on sololearn.com. For this course, I wrote several code projects.

Code Project Descriptions:

- Debug and Fix - Designed to demonstrate mastery of packages, imports and comments.
- Measure Yourself - Demonstrates mastery of variables, data types, relational operators, taking input, and if/else statements.
- Exponential Growth - Demonstrates mastery of using the for loop.
- Say the Numbers - Demonstrates mastery of variables, taking input, and using switch case statements.
- Age on Mars - Demonstrates mastery of writing functions.
- Pointers & Structs Ticking Timer - Demonstrates mastery of using pointers and structs.
- Match Results - Demonstrates mastery of using Array, Range, Map in programming.
- Concurrency Downloader - Demonstrates mastery of using concurrency.

My purpose for writing this software is to further my knowledge of the Golang programming language.

I have created a video to demonstrate my Go learning journey. I show the work I did on sololearn.com.

# Development Environment

The tools that I used to develop the software were the code playground at sololearn.com, the Go Playground at go.dev, VS Code, and GitHub.

The programming language that I used was Go. The libraries used were package main, fmt, and time.}

# Future Work

Things that I need to fix, improve, and add in the future:

- Review the code projects and update with more detailed comments
- Extend my learning with a tutorial for using Go for cloud database.
- Create a cloud database project using Go.
