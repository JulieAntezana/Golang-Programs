This repository contains small programs and a tutorial that I wrote while learning the Kotlin language. I learned Kotlin by completing a course on sololearn.com. For this course, I wrote four code projects. In addition, I worked on a game tutorial:

Water Consumption - designed to demonstrate mastery of variables, operators, comments, and input in Kotlin
Parking Fee - designed to demonstrate mastery of conditional statements.
Shipping Calculator - designed to demonstrate mastery of programming with functions.
Music Player - designed to demonstrate mastery of programming with classes.

My purpose for writing this software is to further my knowledge of the Golang programming language.

I have created a video to demonstrate my Go learning journey. I show the work I did on sololearn.com.

# Overview

This repository contains small programs that I wrote while learning the Golang, or Go language. I learned Go by completing a course on sololearn.com. For this course, I wrote several code projects.

Code Project Descriptions:
Debug and Fix - Designed to demonstrate mastery of packages, imports and comments.
Measure Yourself - Demonstrates mastery of variables, data types, relational operators, taking input, and if/else statements.
Exponential Growth - Demonstrates mastery of using the for loop.
Say the Numbers - Demonstrates mastery of variables, taking input, and using switch case statements.
Age on Mars - Demonstrates mastery of writing functions.
Pointers & Structs Ticking Timer - Demonstrates mastery of using pointers and structs.
Match Results - Demonstrates mastery of using Array, Range, Map in programming.
Concurrency Downloader - Demonstrates mastery of using concurrency.

My purpose for writing this software is to further my knowledge of the Golang programming language.

I have created a video to demonstrate my Go learning journey. I show the work I did on sololearn.com.
